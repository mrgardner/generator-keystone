| generator-keystone | A Yeoman Generator for scaffolding new project builds leveraging Keystone pipelines | 0.1.0 |

# Overview
This project is built on-top of [Yeoman][] to allow developers to quickly and easily scaffold out a [Gulp][] based
build for their projects, leverage [Keystone][] pipelines.  By answering a few simple questions, a whole skeleton build
with a _.gitignore_, _.gitattributes_, _.yo-rc.json _CONTRIBUTING.md_, _README.md_, functional _gulpfile.js_ and fully configured and installed _package.json_ and _bower.json_ will be generated
for you.

**NOTE: as this project is still pre 1.0.0, it is subject to possible backwards incompatible changes as it matures.
