| generator-keystone | A Yeoman Generator for scaffolding new project builds leveraging Keystone pipelines | 0.1.0 |

# Overview
This project is built on-top of [Yeoman][] to allow developers to quickly and easily scaffold out a [Gulp][] based 
build for their projects, leverage [Keystone][] pipelines.  By answering a few simple questions, a whole skeleton build 
with a functional _gulpfile.js_ and fully configured and installed _package.json_ and _bower.json_ will be generated 
for you.

**NOTE: this project is now in 1.0.0 release candidate stage.  1.0.0-rc tags will be published to NPM to allow 
developers to review and provided feedback.**
